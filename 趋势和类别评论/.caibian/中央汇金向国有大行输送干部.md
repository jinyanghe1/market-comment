# Editorial Plan: The "Visible Hand" Tightens

**Target Publication:** Financial Times (Companies & Markets / Asia-Pacific Economy)
**Genre:** Deep-dive / Analysis
**Tone:** Authoritative, measured, analytical, historically grounded, slightly skeptical yet objective.

### 1. The Pitch (Editorial Thesis)

This is not merely a personnel announcement; it is a signal of the next phase in China’s state capitalism. The appointment of a bailout-veteran to a top bank, combined with the rapid expansion of Central Huijin’s portfolio (from 19 to 26 institutions in one year), suggests Beijing is shifting from "passive shareholder" to "active risk manager." We will frame this as the consolidation of China’s "National Team" 2.0, moving from the restructuring era of the early 2000s to a new era of centralized crisis-proofing.

### 2. Proposed Headlines

* **Primary:** Beijing tightens grip on financial system as sovereign fund arm expands reach.
* **Secondary:** Central Huijin’s portfolio swells to 26 firms, signalling a new era of interventionist state supervision.
* **The "Big Read" Option:** The Leviathan’s Ledger: Inside Central Huijin’s quiet expansion.

### 3. Article Structure & Narrative Arc

#### **Part I: The Hook – The Signal in the Noise**

* **The News:** Start with the specific appointment (the female executive moving from Huijin to a "Big Four" bank).
* **The "Tell":** Highlight her background—specifically "financial institution bailout" (金融机构救助) and "equity management." This isn't a growth hire; it's a stability hire.
* **The Scoop:** Reveal the exclusive data point from the text: Huijin’s direct holdings jumped from 19 to 26 in 2025. This is a massive, under-reported consolidation of state assets.

#### **Part II: The Machinery – Inside the Black Box**

* **Internal Restructuring:** Detail the creation of the "Third Equity Management Department" (股权管理三部) in 2024.
* **Analysis:** FT style analysis of bureaucracy. Why create a new department? It implies these 7 new assets are distinct—likely distressed assets or strategic consolidations that required a specialized "SWAT team" approach (the 7 task forces mentioned) before being normalized.

#### **Part III: Historical Depth (Vertical Comparison)**

* **Flashback 2003:** Contrast the current state with Huijin’s birth. In 2003, it was a vehicle to recapitalize insolvent banks (injecting forex reserves).
* **The Shift:** For years, Huijin claimed to be a "passive" financial investor.
* **Current Reality:** Argue that the "passive" era is over. With the transfer of 7 new entities, Huijin is becoming a super-regulator/owner hybrid, blurring the lines between the MOF (Ministry of Finance) and commercial banking.

#### **Part IV: Horizontal Comparison (Global Context)**

* **The Singapore Model:** Briefly compare with Temasek. Temasek manages for yield; Huijin manages for *policy stability*.
* **The US/EU Contrast:** Contrast with the post-2008 TARP (US) or UKFI. Those were temporary; Huijin is permanent.
* **The "Referee vs. Player" Controversy:** Address the long-standing criticism. If Huijin sits on the board and sends cadres, does it override corporate governance? Is this a rollback of the "modern enterprise system" reforms?

#### **Part V: Conclusion – The Fortress Economy**

* **Synthesis:** The integration of the "Third Department's" work into routine management signals that the cleanup is done, and the state now permanently owns these problems.
* **Forward Look:** Expect more personnel shuffling ("parachuting cadres") to ensure the state's will is executed at the operational level of these banks.

### 5. Illustration Suggestions (for the Art Director)

* **Concept:** "The Anchor and the Helm."
* **Imagery:** A stylized, heavy classic bank vault door, but the locking mechanism is shaped like the Chinese bureaucratic seal (chop).
* **Alternative:** A minimalist line drawing of a Go board (Weiqi). A hand places a single stone (the new executive) which changes the territory control of the entire board. This evokes strategy, patience, and encirclement.
* **Color Palette:** FT "Salmon Pink" background, with slate greys and muted reds for the data elements.
